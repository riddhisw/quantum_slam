# Quantum Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (QSLAM)

#### BACKGROUND

The purpose of this repo is to make public algorithmic code associated with the research publication:

Gupta, R.S. et. al., 2019. Adaptive scheduling of noise characterization in quantum computers. arXiv: (forthcoming)

This repo is intended to provide visibility of core algorithms in a research publication. The theoretical algorithm design decisions are justified in the research publication. 
It is possible to code all algorithms based on the research publication alone, and parameter regime information has been provided to reproduce all reported data figures. 

In addition to the publication above, we publish Python packages associated with the paper. For ease of reference, the following Python modules directly link to algorithms reported in the paper:

    qslam : core functionality of the Quantum SLAM Framework
    statedetectn, clfanalysis : helper packages for inputing experimental data into QSLAM
    
The paperdata folder contains Python scripts to generate engineered data and plot results
for simulations corressponding to the main paper and the supplement. 

For questions regarding the publication and supporting code, please contact R. Gupta at riddhi.sw@gmail.com.
